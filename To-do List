TODO List:

 - Move parsing and initialization of library book back to IOModule. 
 	The book should just be a container for parsed fields, not another parser.

 - Add a unique exception and user-friendly message for the parsing of each field.
 
 - Finish the predicate for 'in stock' books.
 
 - Add a 'Clear Filters' button.
 
 - Add a dialog / detail window for selected books.
 
 - Add tooltips.

 - Move on with life.
